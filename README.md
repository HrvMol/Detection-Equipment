Hey modders!

Detection Equipment is a semi-realistic detection and EWAR mod for Space Engineers.

This is the base mod, and must be referenced as a dependency for client mods. [Check out the wiki]() (once I make it) for more information and guides, and feel free to message @aristeas. on Discord if you have any questions or comments.
